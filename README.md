## Higher beings, these words are for you alone

I'm a 18 years old french Rustacean.\
I have been using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for two years.\
I am particularly interested in automation (bots and servers), and I am doing some reverse engineering.

### Opinions

#### Stop using banks

Banks are known to create money out of nothing.
They do not own as much money as the sum of their customers accounts.
This increases the debt of the customers and increases the wealth of the owners.
That is not useful in any way to the humankind and it favoritize the destruction of the environnement, since we always have to produce more to refund the always increasing debt.
We have to stop using banks and switch to crypto as soon as we can. Crypto can be trusted and its value is much more real than private bank money, which does not even exist.

#### Counterattack against dictatorships

Dictatorships are increasingly powerful. By buying products produced in dictatorships, we are financing their progress. We are giving them money, and we all know that this money will be used against us in the future. Our money is used for oppression. Our money is used to maintain dissident citizens in prison, to build new internment camps for Uyghurs, to install thousands of cameras in the streets, to corrupt men, and to build the weapons that will be used to overthrow democracies one by one. **We are responsible** for what is happening there. We have to stop this. Stop buying Chinese phones. We have to put a **complete embargo** on China, Russia, North Korea, and all the countries where the people are not free. Democracies cannot survive under their attacks, but they cannot survive without our money. Check the status of any government [here](https://freedomhouse.org/).
