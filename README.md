### Higher beings, these words are for you alone

Among the entire web, you have come to my Github profile.\
It would be a shame if you left before reading this to the end.\
\
I have been a Rustacean ([Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) developer) for almost two years.\
I am particularly interested in automation (bots and servers), and I am doing some reverse engineering.

#### My work on emails

I made several tools for emails in Rust.
* [email parser](https://github.com/Mubelotix/email-parser)
* [SMTP library](https://github.com/Mubelotix/smtp-server)
* [DKIM library](https://github.com/Mubelotix/dkim)
